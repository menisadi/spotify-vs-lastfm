## Introduction: The Allure and Authority of Spotify Wrapped

Every December, a familiar wave ripples across social media: colorful graphics, quirky stats, and bold declarations of musical identity. Spotify Wrapped has become a cultural phenomenon — a tradition as anticipated as the holidays themselves. It promises a neat, data-driven summary of who we are, based on our listening habits. "Your year in music," it claims.

For many of us, it's more than just a fun recap — it's a mirror, a validation of our tastes, and sometimes even a source of humor (or shame). Parents, for instance, often find themselves sheepishly explaining why "Baby Shark" is their most-played song of the year.

We trust Wrapped to be accurate. After all, if anyone knows what we listened to most in 2024, surely it's Spotify.

But what if it’s not quite as accurate as we think?

For me, the first seeds of doubt were planted when I noticed something odd: two songs I knew I had played countless times — "Sailor Song" by Gigi Perez and "Sunset" by Caroline Polachek — were nowhere to be found in my Top 5. It didn’t add up.

Faced with the mystery of my missing favorites, I turned to a tool that has quietly, faithfully tracked my listening habits for years: Last.FM.

For those unfamiliar, Last.FM is a music tracking service that "scrobbles" — or records — every song you listen to across various platforms. It creates a detailed log of your music history, minute by minute, play by play. While it isn’t as flashy as Spotify Wrapped, it's built around the idea of precision and transparency. If you listened to "Sunset" three times in a row at 2 a.m., Last.FM knows.

To perform the comparison, I needed Spotify’s version of my listening stats. Unfortunately, Spotify doesn't provide users with a full, downloadable record of their annual listening history. However, they do generate a playlist called "Your Top Songs 2024", which compiles what they claim are your most played songs of the year. I extracted the tracklist from this playlist and used it as the best available proxy for Spotify’s internal ranking.

With the two lists — Last.FM’s data and Spotify’s playlist — side-by-side, the discrepancies became immediately obvious.

    (Here you can insert a small table or plot — even something simple like top 10 songs from each source, and visually mark where they differ.)

For instance, [Sailor Song by Gigi Perez] and [Sunset by Caroline Polachek] ranked very high in my Last.FM scrobbles — but didn’t even crack the Top 5 in Spotify’s playlist. Meanwhile, some songs I barely remembered showed up suspiciously high in Spotify’s rankings.

Seeing these differences raised a new question:
By how much, exactly, do the two lists differ?
A few mismatches could be understandable — but could I somehow measure how similar (or different) the two rankings really were?

The next step was clear: I needed a way to quantify the disagreement.
